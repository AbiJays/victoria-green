Website for a hypnotherapy provider

**Favourite Feature:**  I had no experience creating a webpage that was this intricate, let alone a 26 page website so this was a huge learning curve but I was so happy with the final outcome. There have since been multiple edit requests from the owner, which I have not been a part of so I don't have a properly accurate portrayal of what I made.

**Greatest Challenge:** Trying to judge margins and paddings and central positioning when all of the elements you are working with have curves was incredibly hard and I'm not entirely sure my choices were the best ones but I was unable to pinpoint or get any explicit answer from anyone regarding this. This continues to frustrate me however I was given the option to improve my understanding of margins and curves when working on Elocution Coach so I do believe I have improved. 

**In an Ideal World:** I would have loved to add self drawing svg animations to this website in place of the outline images.
